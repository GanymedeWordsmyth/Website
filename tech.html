            <h3>Getting Started with Terraform for AWS Automation</h3>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>Welcome to the first post on my tech blog! I’m excited to kick things off with a topic that’s been a game-changer for me: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. For anyone managing cloud infrastructure, especially with AWS, Terraform is a powerful tool that allows you to automate the deployment and management of your resources efficiently. As someone transitioning into tech and exploring cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure, I’ve found Terraform to be an essential skill in managing complex environments with ease.</p>
             <p>In this post, I’ll introduce Terraform, explain why it’s useful, and walk you through setting up your first Terraform configuration on AWS.</p>
